# Gruvbox-Material for Visual Studio

A port of sainnhe's [gruvbox-material-vscode](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-vscode) to Visual Studio, which in turn was inspired by morhetz' original [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for Vim.

Contains 2 themes:

### gruvbox-material-dark
- An 'as faithful as possible' port using the [theme-converter-for-vs](https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter-for-vs)

### gruvbox-material-dark-custom
- My customizations on top of the ported theme

## Features
- C# files are themed and consistent
- **Limited** support for C/C++ files - only under the `gruvbox-material-dark-custom` theme

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by jekelly's [gruvboxvs](https://github.com/jekelly/gruvboxvs)

## Contribution
My time to work on this project is limited - and visual studio's method of building custom themes is a real pain.
