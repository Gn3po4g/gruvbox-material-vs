# Gruvbox-Material for VS

A port of sainnhe's [gruvbox-material-vscode](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-vscode) to Visual Studio, which in turn was inspired by morhetz' original [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for Vim.

Contains 2 themes:

### gruvbox-material-dark
- An 'as faithful as possible' port using the [theme-converter-for-vs](https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter-for-vs)

### gruvbox-material-dark-custom
- My customizations on top of the ported theme
